DISAGREEING;AGREEING
I'm afraid I disagree;I couldn't agree with you more
I totally disagree;We're on the same page
I beg to differ;That's for sure
I'd say the exact opposite;Tell me about it!
Not necessarily;You're absolutely right
That's not always true;That's exactly how I feel
That's not always the case;I have to side with you on this one
No I'm not so sure about that;No doubt about it
I see your point but;You have a point there
That's one way of looking at it however;I was just going to say that
Well I see things differently;Ok that's convincing
I'm not sure I go along with that view;You took the words right out of my mouth
I agree up to a point but;I'd go along with that
I wouldn't put it that way myself;Actually I think you're right
I find that very difficultl to accept;I second that
There is no way I could agree with that;I take your word on it
I see what you mean but;I share your point of view
I still have my doubts;I feel the same way
That's out of question;You nailed it on the head
